## How to explain ML-Ai community to your GrandMa?

ML-Ai community believes in _Unity is the strength_. We are living in an era of Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence
revolution where world is focusing on building smart solutions to solve both solved and unsolved problems. 
ML-Ai community believes, we can make future bright by focusing on two things.

- **Research** We observed the industry is far behind the academic research hence it takes
a lot time to make use of academic research. Few of the times, academic research adoption takes more time because of 
multiple constraints like worth in the market/marker demand etc but many time we are not able to utilise the full potential 
because of less common platforms between industry researchers and academic researchers. _**`ML-Ai is designed to work as bridge between
academic researchers and industry.`**_
- **Making People Smart** ML-Ai community will have people from beginner to experts and objective will be to cross learn and lead to better future. _**`ML-Ai Experts will act like a Professor`**_ to other people in the community. Professors will help others in their projects, doing code reviews helping them with right researcher papers.

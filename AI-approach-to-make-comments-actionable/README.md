# An Artificial Intelligence Based Approach To Make Comments Actionable

## Abstract

Today, it is common to see comments from the users in any social media posts which reveals a lot of latent information about published content. The community feedback for the published content is a crucial and affluent source of community insights. In this project, I present an in-depth study of comments taken from YouTube videos posted on variouslearning topics related to Artifical Intelligence, Machinea Learning, Deep Learning, Analytics etc.

The study has been done for 70,080 raw comments taken from 60 videos published on YouTube by 25 channels from 2016 to 2021. The YouTube Data API has been used to extract these data from the YouTube videos. The analysis focuses on identifying patterns from the comments, understanding users’ sentiments, exploring subjects and expectations from the users for the next videos from the text summarization. This also includes how topics evolve over a period which is a significant source for any channel that publishes content. I have used different techniques of text analytics and NLP in this analysis like ngram, VADER sentiment analysis, HateSonar hate speech detection, LDA for topic modelling, TextRank for text summarization, and BERTopic for dynamic topic modelling.

Finally, as a result of my analysis, I have got the topics evolved as significance with a summary over a period, where the video channels or owners can decide on the topic for their next videos which are in demand or can take decisions on the improvement of their videos as per the concerns or complaints by the users in their comments.
The outcome of this study would help the video creator to take action on their content and will help them to increase views or people's engagement to their videos. This approach could be for other social network platforms also. The results of my evaluations are promising and indicate a commercially viable product and service when implemented as an API service, which canassist any blogger/vlogger or enterprises involve in social media content publications where they can get a clue on users’ demand and being ahead of competitors.

The API shall give four major areas as output, the sentiments of users, dominant topics of what they discuss, a summary of the user comments, and evolution of topics over time as a dashboard for the given input of user comments, date and time for their content publications. The content creator can take action on the comments based on the results from the dashboard of API.

As a future scope, content based recommendation and collaborative filtering using more user based data have been planned.
